REQ-16 is not implemented: no static asset files were added under frontend/public, despite references to /assets/generated/ngfc-favicon.dim_64x64.png and required generated logo assets.",

      "reason": "No files were added, and the diff does not show any new assets under `frontend/public` (where `/assets/...` must exist). The change to `frontend/index.html` references `/assets/generated/ngfc-favicon.dim_64x64.png`, but the corresponding image file is not added in this diff summary.",
